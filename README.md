# STM32WB-HCI

forked from [bluetooth_hci](https://github.com/danielgallagher0/bluetooth-hci)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/OueslatiGhaith/stm32wb-hci/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OueslatiGhaith/stm32wb-hci/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This crate defines a pure Rust implementation of the [Bluetooth Host-Controller Interface](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWB/) for the STM32WB family of microcontrollers. It defines commands
and events from the specification, and vendor-specific commands and events.

## Version

This crate aims to match the [latest firmware binaries](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWB/tree/master/Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x) released by ST. The minor version number of this crate should indicate the appropriate firmware version to use, refer to this table in unclear:

| crate version | firmware version | notes       |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 0.170X.X      | 1.17.1           | Token forks |
| 0.17.2        | 1.17.1           |             |
| 0.17.0        | 1.17.0           |             |
| 0.16.0        | 1.16.0           |             |
| older         | 1.15.0           |             |

## Usage

This crate defines a trait (`Controller`) that should be implemented
for a specific BLE chip. Any implementor can then be used as a
`host::uart::UartHci` to read and write to the chip.

    impl stm32wb_hci::Controller for MyController {
        async fn controller_write(&mut self, header: &[u8], payload: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
            // implementation...
        }
        async fn controller_read_into(&mut self, buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
            // implementation...
        }
    }

The entire Bluetooth HCI is implemented in terms of these functions
that handle the low-level I/O.
